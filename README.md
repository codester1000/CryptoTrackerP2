# CryptoTracker

## Technologies Used
EJS to create a wireframe for the website, that is used for each of the pages
CSS and Bootstrap to make the website look presentable
JavaScript creates all the usabality of the website, including the CRUD and RESTFUL API
Express, MongoDB and Mongoose was 
Markup language is only used for the README file

## Planning and Development Process
Planning was mostly done using a written formula of the process because it was easier to visualise the process. 
Handwriting helps me visualise a long winded process of creating a complicated website, which includes many different steps that can lead to a website. I write the steps of the project in order to give myself a sort of to do list.
I needed to add quite a bit of functionality, that in the end I didn't end up having, due to time constraints.

## Unsolved Problems
I have 2 main unsolved problems, that I will continue to work on in order to create a better website for my portfolio:
1. My sign in, sign out functionality does not work, as I did not have enough time to get the relationship between the user and crypto databases.
2. An external API that I could not seem to implement properly, this was due to a lack of time, I spent a lot of time trying to get this to work, and I could not finalise it in time, it is still in the middle of the development phase

Additionally, I would like to try and create a graph that would access data, from the past week or month and store it, in order to track how much your crypto is worth

## Favourite Functions
At the moment I dont really have any favourite functions, as I don't particularly like any of it, cause most of it frustrated me for days on end. When my fetching of an API works, that will be my favourite function

## What I did wrong (this is mostly for me later)
Time management; spent too much time on one thing, and the functionality of the website went out the window. 
Ask for help more; tried to fix everything myself, which then doesn't help me, because the internet sometimes sucks for very specific things
